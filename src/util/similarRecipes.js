    instructions:
      "Add onions and carrots to the melted butter and saute for 5-6 minutes over medium heat, or until vegetables are tender. Add 1 cup chicken broth and bring to the boil. Add broccoli and cook, covered, 5 to 6 minutes or until the broccoli is tender. Using a spoon, break broccoli florets in small pieces. Reduce heat to low and add remaining cup of chicken broth. Mix flour and milk in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Add mixture to the pot. Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking for about 5-6 minutes over low heat until soup thickens. Add cheese, handfuls at a time, and stir constantly over low heat for 10 minutes until smooth and creamy. If soup becomes too thick, add additional chicken stock. Do not let soup boil.",

    instructions:
      "Combine the diced rhubarb,sugar, the cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb releases its liquid and begins to breakdown, creating a thick, chunky sauce, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Layer 4 phyllo sheets, brushing each with melted butter. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Now let us cut four 4-inch squares from phyllo stack. Place 2 teaspoons of filling in center of square. Brush phyllo from edge of filling to each point of square lightly with water. Gather points of square and pinch together just above filling. Brush pouch with butter. Repeat process for all 4 pouches. Place filled pouches at least 1 apart on ungreased cookie sheet or baking pan. Bake in preheated 350F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Take the pouches out and let them cool on wire rack for ~5 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

    instructions:
      "Spray 6 ramekins or juice glasses with the nonstick cooking spray. Add the half and half to a saucepan over low-medium heat (dont let the mixture get too hot or come to a boil). When warm, sprinkle the gelatin over the mixture, and stir it to dissolve it. Add the mascarpone and stir until melted. Add the sugar, orange zest and vanilla, and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let it stand for about 5 minutes. Pour the mixture evenly into the ramekins or glasses. Cover and refrigerate for at least four hours, but ideally overnight. Meanwhile, put the raspberries in a bowl and press them softly with a fork to produce some juice. Add the orange juice and confectioners sugar and mix together. Keep the berry mixture refrigerated until youre ready to serve the panna cotta. When the panna cotta has set, move a knife around the edges of the ramekin or glasses to loosen it, and gently shake each onto individual plates. Drizzle the berry mixture over each serving.",

      "Instructions First you will want to place your cream cheese into a medium sized bowl and beat until smooth. Once the cream cheese is smooth, gradually add in the powdered sugar a little at a time and continue to beat until smooth. Add in the vanilla and chocolate and beat until you have once again reached a smooth consistency. Cover and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour. After one hour, use a 2 inch cookie scoop and create perfectly round truffles. Delicious Chocolate Truffle Recipe To decorate, use melting chocolate candies in different colors and dip with a fork, then place on waxed paper to completely harden. Then dip truffles in a second coat of chocolate and coat with sprinkles or other toppings while still tacky. Allow to completely harden before serving.",
